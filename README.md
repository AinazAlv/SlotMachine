# Slot Machine Game

## Overview
I'm starting to practice coding again, so I decided to work on this project. The idea for this slot machine game was inspired by a YouTube channel, Tech With Tim, but I made some modifications to customize it to my preferences.

This project serves as a coding exercise to help me review and remember.

## Description
This Python-based slot machine game allows players to deposit an initial balance, bet on multiple lines, and spin the reels to test their luck. The game implements a simple slot machine logic where you can win by matching symbols on the same line. The game provides feedback on wins and losses, updates the player's balance, and offers the option to continue playing or quit.

In the future, I might add some graphical design to enhance the visual aspects of the game.

## Getting Started
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install Numpy and Random, if not already installed: `pip install numpy/random`.
- Run the game by executing `slot_machine.py`.

## Gameplay
- Deposit an initial balance.
- Choose the number of lines to bet on.
- Place your bet for each line.
- Spin the slot machine and see if you win!
